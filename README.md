# ðŸš€ BlockChain Chat

Welcome to the Blockchain Chat App, a decentralized Dapp project created using Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js, JavaScript, and React!

## Overview

In this project, I've developed a blockchain-based chat application for secure and transparent messaging. Leveraging blockchain networks like Ethereum, it ensures message integrity and privacy through decentralized verification. With features such as end-to-end encryption and decentralized authentication, the platform offers a trustworthy solution for modern communication needs.

## Features:


##### -Decentralized Messaging: No central server; messages transmitted directly between users via blockchain.

##### -Immutable Records: Messages stored on blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof history.

##### -Censorship Resistance: Resilient to censorship; users have unrestricted communication.

##### -End-to-End Encryption: Messages encrypted for privacy and security.

##### -User Anonymity: Optional anonymity with no personal data required.

##### -Smart Contract Integration: Facilitates secure message delivery and access control.

##### -Token Economy: Potential for token incentives or premium features.

##### -Multi-platform Access: Accessible across various devices and platforms.


## Technologies Used:


##### - Blockchain: Ethereum network for decentralized messaging.
##### - Solidity: Smart contract language for user authentication and message handling.
##### - Hardhat: Ethereum development environment for testing and deployment.
##### - Ethers.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.
##### - React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
  
## How to Use:


##### 1) Register: Create an account with a username and password.

##### 2) Login: Access your account securely.

##### 3) Add Friend: Send a friend request; friend must be registered.
